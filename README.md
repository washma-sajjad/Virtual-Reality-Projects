## Included Labs

### Lab 4 – Terrain Environment

This lab demonstrates the use of Unity’s Terrain Tools to create a natural 3D environment.

**Key Features:**
- Custom terrain sculpting (mountains and elevation)
- Tree placement and environmental detailing
- Terrain textures and layering
- Scene organization and environment layout

This scene focuses on world-building fundamentals and environmental design inside Unity.

### Lab 5 – Rigidbody Physics Arena

This lab demonstrates Unity’s physics system using Rigidbody and Collider components.

**Key Features:**
- Multiple 3D primitives (cube, sphere, capsule)
- Rigidbody-based gravity and collision simulation
- Sliding and bouncing interactions on ramps
- Physic Materials (friction and bounciness adjustments)
- Prefab creation and reuse
- Directional, Point, and Spot lighting setup
- Visual differences under multiple lighting zones

This scene highlights how Unity handles physical simulation and real-time lighting.
